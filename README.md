# Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I have created my very first portfolio to help showcase the many other projects that I have done, and will be doing in the future. This page will make it easier to share my quality of work in a concise way so that future employers and friends can see for themselves what I am capable of instead of me having to tell them. Some of the things I learned from building this page are:

-How to keep images inside of a container.
-How to place text over a background image.
-How to accomodate for different screen sizes and viewports.
-How to position text and images in the same box.
-How to embed links and have them open in a new tab.
-How to include social media logos.

## Table of Contents 

The sections of this site are:

- Navigation
- About Me
- My Work
- Contact

## Installation

There is no need to install a thing! All you need is a device with a browser and internet access.
